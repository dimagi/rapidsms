Contributions Sought
======================

There are a few places throughout this wiki which have been marked TODO. If you know what you're talking about, feel free to add the missing pieces there.

Other high-level missing pieces which have been requested include: translation into French and Arabic.

Editing / Markup
==================

To edit documentation, the easiest way would be to fork the rapidsms/rapidsms repo, edit the docs on your personal github repo, and
then issue a pull request.  Doc changes will be moved in extremely quickly (as any documentation is better than none)!

Offline Editing / Viewing
===========================

To build the documentation, you'll need to have sphinx installed::

    $ pip install Sphinx
    
Then, build the html documentation from the .rst files.  From within the doc directory, run:: 

    $ make html
